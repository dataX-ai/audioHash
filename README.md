## üéØ Features

- Advanced mel spectrogram analysis
- Adaptive peak detection algorithm
- Time-sensitive audio fingerprinting
- Robust audio comparison capabilities
- Visualization tools for analysis

## üîç Technical Overview

This project implements an advanced audio fingerprinting system that:

- Converts audio to mel spectrograms using librosa
- Employs adaptive threshold techniques for peak detection
- Normalizes frequency, time, and amplitude data
- Generates consistent fingerprints for audio comparison

### Key Components

- **Mel Spectrogram Generation**: Uses 128 mel bands with 2048 FFT window size
- **Peak Detection**: Adaptive algorithm with configurable parameters
- **Normalization**: Frequency (0-1), Time (seconds), Amplitude (0-1 dB-scaled)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- librosa
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib (for visualization)

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from audioHash import AudioHasher

hasher = AudioHasher()
peaks = hasher.create_time_sensitive_hash('path/to/audio.wav', num_peaks=256)
```

## üìä Visualization

The system includes comprehensive visualization tools:

- Waveform display
- Mel spectrogram with peak overlay
- Peak amplitude distribution
- Normalized peak visualization

## üîß Parameters

- `num_peaks`: Number of peaks to detect (default: 256)
- `n_mels`: Number of mel bands (default: 128)
- `hop_length`: Spectrogram hop length (default: 512)
- `n_fft`: FFT window size (default: 2048)

## üìà Performance

- Adaptive threshold ensures consistent peak detection
- Efficient processing for various audio lengths
- Robust to volume variations
- Time-sensitive matching capabilities
